To the world you may be one person, but to one person you are the world.


I am catastrophically in love with you.
You are my life, I can never stop thinking of you.
I love you more than anyone loves you, or has loved you, or will love you, and also, I love you in a way that no one loves you, or has loved you, or will love you, and also, I love you in a way that I love no one else, and never have loved anyone else, and never will love anyone else.

I miss the way you used to hug me, I miss the way you used to kiss my lips, but most of all I miss the way you held me and my heart. I miss you…

Before I sleep and after I wake up and all the hours in between … you occupy my mind. So, practically every moment of the day you are in my thoughts. I miss you.

I miss you! Because you taught me how to feel emptiness when you’re not here.
